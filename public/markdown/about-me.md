# About Me

I am a skilled Frontend Developer with over three years of experience, specializing in JavaScript, particularly React and Typescript. My expertise was nurtured through my involvement in various projects where I owned and built upon my frontend skills. Additionally, my initial role on the QA testing team has given me a unique perspective and attention to detail in development.

Outside of work, I am an active member of Mega Coders, a startup consultancy, where I have expanded my skill set into mobile development for Android and iOS platforms. This experience has allowed me to work with technologies such as Expo and Android Studio, broadening my capabilities in creating mobile applications.
